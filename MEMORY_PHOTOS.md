# Memory Photos Setup

## Add Your Memory Photos

Save your memory photos to the valentines folder with these names:

1. **memory1.jpg** - Your first memory together (e.g., when you first met)
2. **memory2.jpg** - A special moment you shared
3. **memory3.jpg** - Another cherished memory

All photos should be saved in: `C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\valentines\`

## Customize the Memory Text

Edit `index.html` and update the memory text to match your actual memories:

- Line ~74: "When we first met... ✨" → Change to your actual first memory
- Line ~81: "That amazing day together 💖" → Change to your special moment
- Line ~88: "Every moment with you 🌹" → Change to your third memory

## Tips:
- Use landscape photos (horizontal) for best display
- Photos will be cropped to fit 350x250px boxes
- Keep the text short and sweet (one line each)
- You can add more memory items by copying the memory-item div structure

The memory roadmap will appear right before the big question! 💕
