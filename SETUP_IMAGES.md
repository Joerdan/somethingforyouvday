# Rose Petal Images Setup

## Important: Save Your Rose Petal Images

You need to save the 4 rose petal images you provided to the valentines folder:

1. Save the first petal image as: `petal1.png`
2. Save the second petal image as: `petal2.png`
3. Save the third petal image as: `petal3.png`
4. Save the fourth petal image as: `petal4.png`

All four images should be saved in: `C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\valentines\`

## How to Save the Images:

1. Right-click on each rose petal image you shared
2. Select "Save image as..."
3. Save them with the names above (petal1.png, petal2.png, petal3.png, petal4.png)
4. Make sure they're in the same folder as index.html

Once you've saved all four images, the falling rose petals effect will work perfectly!

## What the Effect Does:

- Rose petals fall from the top of the screen
- Each petal rotates and sways as it falls
- Random sizes, speeds, and rotations for natural movement
- Petals use your actual rose petal images
- Creates a romantic, elegant atmosphere

The petals will appear on all screens and extra petals will celebrate when she says yes!
