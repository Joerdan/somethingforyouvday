## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

Since you're using your work laptop, here's how to manually upload to GitHub:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log into your personal account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
3. Name it something like `valentine-2026` or `be-my-valentine`
4. Make it **Public** (required for GitHub Pages)
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Files

1. On your new repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop these files from `C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\valentines\`:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `README.md` (optional)
3. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository's "Settings" tab
2. Click "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Under "Branch", select `main` (or `master`) and `/ (root)`
5. Click "Save"

### Step 4: Get Your Website URL

1. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
2. Refresh the Pages settings page
3. You'll see: "Your site is live at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`"
4. Share this URL with your girlfriend! 💕

## How It Works

- When she clicks "Yes" first, it tells her to try the "No" button
- When she clicks "No", the button runs away and can't be clicked!
- After trying "No", she can click "Yes" to see the romantic message
- Background music plays automatically (romantic piano music)
- Floating hearts create a romantic atmosphere

## Customization

If you want to change the date details or message, edit the `index.html` file in the success section.
